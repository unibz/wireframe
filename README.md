# Wireframes


### Content first
For the development of the new university website we decide to refract all content. On the old and actual website information regarding the same topic is disseminated on several different pages. During this step we try to address the issue collection similar data on just one page.

During the development of the content we try to narrate a story in every single page combining beautiful texts and attractive graphics with warn and welcoming pictures.

### Mobile first
We decide that no matter what device you are using to visit our website, you should always be able to access the same content. That's why we develop all wireframes with a mobile first methodology. It means that we start to display the content on the smallest screen-size possible. In our case 320px large. So we are constrain to organize the content in a way which is functional also on small displays. 

### Process
In order to achieve this goal we start to refract the content with post-it notes. This is a good strategy because we are not only limited by the width in which we work but also by the tools we use. You can look at our post-it wireframes on the [project timeline](#).
