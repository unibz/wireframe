# Wireframes


### Content first
For the development of the new university website we decide to refract all content. Information architecture is our first concern. On the old and actual website data regarding the same topic is disseminated on several different pages. During this step we try to address this issue collecting similar content on just one page.

During the development of the content we try to narrate a story in every single page combining beautiful texts and attractive graphics with warn and welcoming pictures.

### Mobile first
We decide that no matter what device you are using to visit our website, you should always be able to access the same content. That's why we develop all wireframes with a mobile first methodology. It means that we start to display the content on the smallest screen-size possible. In our case 320px large. So we are constrain to organize the content in a way which is functional also on small displays. 

### Work process
In order to achieve this goal together with the content team we start to refract the information using post-it notes. This is a good strategy because we are not only limited by the width in which we work but also by the tools we use. You can look at our post-it architecture on the [project timeline](http://unibz.github.io/timeline/).

After this step we work with the content team to translate the post-it structure into more detailed wireframes. In order to involve everyone in the process we decide to use Google Drawings. This service allow every team member to add and edit the content easily. You can check several pages always on our [project timeline](http://unibz.github.io/timeline/).

### Presentation
Finally, when the content is ready, we move everything from Google Drawing to responsive wireframes hosted on GitHub Pages. You can view the developed pages [here](http://unibz.github.io/wireframes/).
